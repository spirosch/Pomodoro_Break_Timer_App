You have 25 minutes to study / Work.
When the timer's up it will pop to the very front on the screen above all of the other windows and tell you to take a break.
The first break is for 5 minutes and at the middle of the screen a check mark is appear.
After the 5 minutes you continue to work / study and it's going to continue until you reach the longer break or until you click reset to stop and 
reset the timer.
