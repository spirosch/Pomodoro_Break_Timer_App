You have 25 minutes to work.
When the timer's up it will pop to the very front on the screen above all of the other windows and tell you to take a break.

The first break is for 5 minutes

After the 5 minutes you continue to work and it's going to continue until you reach the longer break (20 minutes) or until you click reset to stop and 
reset the timer.
